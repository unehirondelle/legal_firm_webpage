Code refactoring aimed to apply the mobile website version design to the existing code.
The final goal of the project is to apply the mobile and tablet website versions designs to the existing code using the pure CSS.

The customer ans I are on our way: we've started with prototyping of the mobile webpage version.
Max width for mobile version: 760px

My prototype: https://unehirondelle.github.io/legal_firm_webpage/

Full web page (before the refactoring): http://www.it-lex.ru/legal-cases/patent-na-programmu/
